The methodical approach to database modelling involves multiple steps, starting with the analysis of the given dataset and progressing through design, normalization, and implementation especially when working with a denormalized datasets like the Zulo bank dataset provided.

# The Normalization process 

The goal of normalization is a way to simplify the data , by removing repeated data , dividing into simple tables and columns for effective query and optimization. It removes redundancy and increase efficiency

### The First Normal Form 

* 1NF was achieved by atomizing the dataset
* 2NF broke the dataset into different unique tables
* 3NF was acheived by creating a new date table
