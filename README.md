# Data Modeling and Warehousing

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to exploring the fundamentals of data modeling, normalization, and data warehousing. It provides examples, case studies, and best practices for designing databases that meet business requirements while maintaining efficiency and scalability.

Data modeling is the process of creating a visual representation of data structures and relationships to facilitate the design, implementation, and maintenance of a database. It helps in organizing and understanding data, ensuring that it can be accessed, stored, and manipulated efficiently while supporting business requirements.

## Types of Data Models
- **Conceptual Model**: Focuses on high-level business requirements and relationships.
- **Logical Model**: Provides more detail about entities, attributes, and relationships without being tied to a specific database system.
- **Physical Model**: Translates the logical model into a schema that can be implemented in a specific database system, including table structures, keys, indexes, and other physical considerations.

## Normalization
Normalization aims to simplify data structures by removing redundancy and dividing data into simple tables with unique keys. It ensures efficient querying and optimization.

- **First Normal Form (1NF)**: Ensures that each data cell contains atomic (indivisible) values but may still have redundancy.
- **Second Normal Form (2NF)**: Divides data into smaller, well-defined tables, ensuring each table has a unique primary key and establishing relationships through foreign keys.
- **Third Normal Form (3NF)**: Further reduces redundancy by eliminating transitive dependencies and separating data into distinct tables with unique relationships.
